    <p class="bio">Hi, I'm Eliana! I'm currently a sophmore majoring Information Systems & Marketing at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business.
      In 2016, I discovered the wonders of digital art and have been pursing this passion ever since. However, as time passed by, I've grown
      extremely interested in computers and ended up having two polarly different passions: art and technology. I just couldn't choose between one or the other
      so I wanted to find a way to bridge digital art and technology. This is how I got into web design/development, front-end development, and UI/UX.
